# MD055 - table-pipe-style

Tags: table

Aliases: table-pipe-style

Parameters: style ("consistent", "leading_and_trailing", "leading_only", "trailing_only", or "no_leading_or_trailing"; default "consistent")

This rule is triggered for tables that don't have a consistent style for their leading and trailing pipe characters.

## Rationale

Some parsers have difficulty with tables that are missing their leading or trailing pipe characters. The use of leading/trailing pipes can also help provide visual clarity.

## Examples

The following table is missing its trailing pipe characters:

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------
Cell | Cell |
```

The following table is missing its leading pipe characters:

```markdown
Header | Header |
------ | ------ |
Cell | Cell |
```

Both of the above cases can be fixed by adding the missing pipe characters:

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell | Cell |
```

## Configuration

The `style` parameter can be used to specify which pipe style to expect:

* `consistent` - Tables must have the same style as the first table
* `leading_and_trailing` - Tables must have pipes at the beginning and end of every row
* `leading_only` - Tables must have pipes at the beginning of every row
* `trailing_only` - Tables must have pipes at the end of every row
* `no_leading_or_trailing` - Tables must not have pipes at the beginning or end of rows

## Fixable

This rule supports automatic fixing of violations.
