Tags: whitespace, emphasis

Aliases: no-space-in-emphasis

Fixable: Yes

This rule is triggered when emphasis markers (asterisks and underscores) are
used, but they have spaces between the markers and the text:

```markdown
Here is some * emphasis * and **bold**.
Here is some _ emphasis _ and __bold__.
```

To fix this, remove the spaces:

```markdown
Here is some *emphasis* and **bold**.
Here is some _emphasis_ and __bold__.
```

make it less visually distinct. Per the [CommonMark specification][commonmark-spec],
emphasis markers with spaces inside are not considered emphasis:

> A `*` character can open emphasis iff (if and only if) it is part of a left-
> flanking delimiter run. A `*` character can close emphasis iff it is part of a
> right-flanking delimiter run.
> 
> A delimiter run is a sequence of one or more delimiter characters.
> A left-flanking delimiter run is a delimiter run that is:
