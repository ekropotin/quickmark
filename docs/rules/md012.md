# `MD012` - Multiple consecutive blank lines

Tags: `blank_lines`, `whitespace`

Aliases: `no-multiple-blanks`

Parameters:

- `maximum`: Maximum number of consecutive blank lines (`integer`, default `1`)

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered when you have multiple consecutive blank lines in a document:

```markdown
Some text here


Some more text here
```

To fix this, ensure that only one blank line is used:

```markdown
Some text here

Some more text here
```

The `maximum` parameter can be used to configure the number of consecutive blank lines allowed in a document.

Note: this rule does not trigger on multiple consecutive blank lines inside [code blocks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#code-blocks).

## Rationale

Except in a code block, blank lines serve no purpose and do not affect the rendering of content.
