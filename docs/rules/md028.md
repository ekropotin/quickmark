# MD028 - Blank lines inside blockquote

**Tags:** `blockquote`, `whitespace`

**Aliases:** `no-blanks-blockquote`

This rule is triggered when two blockquote blocks are separated only by a blank line.

## Problematic code

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> which is immediately followed by

> this blockquote.
```

## Correct code

To fix this, there are a couple of options:

### Option 1: Add separating text

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.

And Jimmy also said:

> This too is a blockquote.
```

### Option 2: Extend the same blockquote

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
>
> This is the same blockquote.
```

## Rationale

Some Markdown parsers will treat two blockquotes separated by one or more blank lines as the same blockquote, while others will treat them as separate blockquotes.

## Configuration

This rule is configurable and can be disabled:

```toml
[linters.severity]
no-blanks-blockquote = "off"
```

Or set to warning:

```toml
[linters.severity]
no-blanks-blockquote = "warn"
```
