# MD014 - commands-show-output

Dollar signs used before commands without showing output

## Tags

code

## Description

This rule is triggered when code blocks show shell commands preceded by dollar signs ($), but no output is displayed.

## Examples of violations

```markdown
$ ls
$ cat foo
$ less bar
```

## Examples of correct usage

```markdown
ls
cat foo
less bar
```

Or when output is shown:

```markdown
$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt
$ cat file1.txt
Hello World
```

## Rationale

It is easier to copy/paste and less noisy if the dollar signs are omitted when they are not needed.

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.
