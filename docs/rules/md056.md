# MD056 - Table Column Count

**Tags:** table  
**Aliases:** table-column-count

## Description

This rule checks that all rows in a GitHub Flavored Markdown table have the same number of cells.

## Rationale

"Extra cells in a row are usually not shown, so their data is lost. Missing cells in a row create holes in the table and suggest an omission."

## Example of a Violation

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |
| Cell   |
| Cell   | Cell   | Cell   |
```

## Example of a Correct Table

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |
| Cell   | Cell   |
| Cell   | Cell   |
```

## Key Points

- The header row and delimiter row must have the same number of cells
- Extra cells are usually not displayed
- Missing cells create gaps in the table

## Configuration

This rule has no specific configuration options.

## Fix

To fix this issue:

1. **For missing cells**: Add the missing cells to make the row complete
2. **For extra cells**: Remove the extra cells or move them to appropriate rows
