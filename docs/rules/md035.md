# MD035 - Horizontal rule style

**Tags**: `hr`
**Aliases**: `hr-style`

**Parameter**: 
- `style`: Horizontal rule style (string, default `consistent`)

## Description

The rule checks for consistent horizontal rule styling throughout a document. It is triggered when different horizontal rule styles are used.

## Example of Inconsistent Horizontal Rules

```markdown
---
- - -
***
* * *
****
```

## Example of Consistent Horizontal Rules

```markdown
---
---
```

## Configuration

The rule can enforce a specific horizontal rule style. By default, it ensures consistency with the first horizontal rule used in the document.

### `style`

- `consistent` (default): Uses the first horizontal rule's style as the standard for the document
- Any specific horizontal rule pattern (e.g., `---`, `***`, `___`, `* * *`, etc.): Enforces that exact style

## Rationale

"Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document."

The rule helps maintain visual uniformity by ensuring that all horizontal rules in a document follow the same style, whether using dashes, asterisks, or another consistent delimiter.

## Examples

### Default (consistent) behavior

```markdown
---
Some content
---
More content
```

This is valid because all horizontal rules use the same style.

```markdown
---
Some content
***
More content
```

This triggers a violation because the styles are inconsistent.

### Specific style enforcement

With configuration:
```toml
[linters.settings.hr-style]
style = "***"
```

```markdown
***
Some content
***
More content
```

This is valid because all horizontal rules match the configured style.

```markdown
---
Some content
***
More content
```

This triggers violations for any horizontal rule that doesn't match `***`.
