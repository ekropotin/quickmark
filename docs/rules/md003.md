# `MD003` - Heading style

Tags: `headings`

Aliases: `heading-style`

Parameters:

- `style`: Heading style (`string`, default `consistent`, values `atx` / `consistent` / `setext`)

This rule is triggered when different heading styles are used in the same
document:

```markdown
# ATX style H1

Setext style H1
===============
```

To fix the issue, use consistent heading styles throughout the document:

```markdown
# ATX style H1

## ATX style H2
```

Note: The placement of a horizontal rule directly below a line of text can
trigger this rule by turning that text into a level 2 setext-style heading:

```markdown
A line of text followed by a horizontal rule becomes a heading
---
```

Rationale: Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.
