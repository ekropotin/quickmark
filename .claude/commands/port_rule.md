The goal is to port $ARGEMENTS rule implementation from the original markdownlinter.
Think hard to create an implementation plan. It must include writing comprehensive unit-tests covering as much as possible combinations of rule's settings as possible. Embrace TDD approach. This means, start with writing minimum set of data structurs needed for a test, refrain from writing actual logic for linting at this stage. When, write unit tests. Confirm they are failing. When keep implementing/refining the logic until tests are green.
You'd also need to create new samples for that rule in `test-samples` directory, following existing naming conventions.
Finally, you must validate that the implementation is consistent with markdownlinter. This can be done via running both linters against test samples and when analyzing the output. If any inconsistencies found - you must fix them. Assume markdownlinter is already installed on this machine locally. For any found actual inconsistency, add unit test.
At the end, copy original rule documentation in `docs/rules`
